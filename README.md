LD22-Alone
==========

alone

submission for ludum dare 22, archived on github.

This game was created in one weekend for the Ludum Dare 22 competition.
The theme of the competition was "Alone". I decided to try to make an artistic game.

All of the programming, graphics and audio were made by me. I started from scratch and recycled no code or assets.

The programming was all done in C++ using SFML as a media library.
The graphics were made in GIMP and ms paint.
The audio was recorded from a decoration I found in my house. I distorted the same sound using Audacity to produce the BGM of the first half of the game.

The main cool things of this project are:
- 2D animation engine in SFML with support for defining constant real values, points, rectangles and animation sequences from .anim files.
- Successful implementation of one of my personal favourite game programming design patterns: Sequencer (A queue of commands that can take arbitrary amounts of time to execute)
- Now cross-platform on anything SFML supports

This game was rated #21 for Mood, and #22 for Theme.
It also was rated #116 for Graphics and #139 for Audio.
The total number of games submitted to Ludum Dare 22 was 891, which means that this game stood out.

I received many comments on this game complementing the emotion, with one commenter even declaring it their "favorite game on this LD!".

As you might tell, I'm pretty proud of this game. Making it was a lot of fun, and one of my most artistic programming experiences. I'd like to try to make more games like this and get better at conveying emotions through games.
